# Introduction to Seldon Recommendation Engine

The Seldon Recommendation Engine (SRE) allows recommendations to be generated based on structured historical data. It has a variety of algorithms to produce these recommendations and can report a variety of statistics.


## Why you would use it (examples)

Seldon has been designed generically so that it can be useful in many contexts. It was first developed for the media industry. It recommended content for users to view on a website based on the content that the user had previously looked at.

Other examples of use include:

* e-commerce where the recommendations are again based on items that the user has viewed as well as the items that they have bought.
* general personalisation of a website.
