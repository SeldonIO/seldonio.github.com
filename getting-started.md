   * Loading your data into Seldon

## Can I use Seldon in my project?
Yes. Seldon is licensed under the permissive Apache Licence, Version 2.0. So please feel free to use Seldon in either commercial or non-commercial projects. And no, you do not have to make your project open source.

## Is it production ready?
Seldon VM is closed alpha release for testing and demonstration purposes only. Do not use it in production. Seldon will shortly release the project source code and seperate Docker containers for the separate components which have been tested in high traffic production environments.

Seldon has been running a SaaS service at scale (over a billion API calls per month) with extremely high availability and low latency. If you want to run Seldon Cloud in production, please contact [hello@seldon.io](mailto:hello@seldon.io)
