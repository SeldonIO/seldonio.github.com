# Seldon AMI for Amazon Web Services

For AWS users, we have created an all-in-one packaged Seldon as an AMI.  
Use the [**Get Started**](//www.seldon.io/get-started/) page to get details on how to launch the Seldon AMI.

The Seldon AMI is a self-contained environment with the full Seldon platform pre-configured for you to test with your service data. It contains the same tools as [Seldon VM](vm.html), and a movie recommender demo that serves as an example to show you [how to load your data](data.html) for content recommendation.

You should run the Seldon AMI on at least an m3.medium sized instance.

After creating a new instance of AMI and logging on, see the [Seldon VM usage](vm-usage.html) docs for getting started.
