# Seldon Core 


**Seldon Core is an open source platform for deploying machine learning models on Kubernetes.**

## Goals

 - Allow data scientists to create models using any machine learning toolkit or programming language. We plan to initially cover the tools/languages below:
   - Python based models including
     - Tensorflow models
     - Sklearn models
   - Spark models
   - H2O models
   - R models
 - Expose machine learning models via REST and gRPC automatically when deployed for easy integration into business apps that need predictions.
 - Allow complex runtime inference graphs to be deployed as microservices. These graphs can be composed of:
   - Models - runtime inference executable for machine learning models
   - Routers - route API requests to sub-graphs. Examples: AB Tests, Multi-Armed Bandits.
   - Combiners - combine the responses from sub-graphs. Examples: ensembles of models
   - Transformers - transform request or responses. Example: transform feature requests.
 - Handle full lifecycle management of the deployed model:
    - Updating the runtime graph with no downtime
    - Scaling
    - Monitoring
    - Security
