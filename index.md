# Seldon

Seldon is an Open Predictive Platform that provides content recommendations and general predictive functionality. It runs within a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) Cluster and can therefore be deployed anywhere Kubernetes can be deployed: on-premise or in cloud (e.g., [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com)). It can scale to the demands of large enterprise installations.
