# Introduction to Seldon

Seldon is an Open Predictive Platform that currently provides content recommendations and general predictive functionality. It runs within a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) Cluster and can therefore be deployed anywhere Kubernetes can be deployed: on-premise or in cloud (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). It can scale to the demands of large enterprise installations.
